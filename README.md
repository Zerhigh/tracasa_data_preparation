# Repository: tracasa_data_preparation

This repository is part of the master’s thesis: [Evaluating_Sentinel-2_Super-Resolution_Algorithms_for_Automated_Building_Delineation](https://github.com/Zerhigh/Evaluating_Sentinel-2_Super-Resolution_Algorithms_for_Automated_Building_Delineation)

This project contains scripts and utilities for preparing the tracasa dataset used in evaluating proprietary super-resolution algorithms on Sentinel-2 imagery, for the purpose of automated building delineation.

The repository includes:

- `process.py` — logic for extracting images of shape `(4, 512, 512)` from a single large tracasa image based on the stratified test dataset.
